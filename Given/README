Overall: Any comment/discussion related to this HW.

For part8 we feel that our methodology was fairly elegant. 
	Not only is there no redundancy in the code through our use of polymorphism,
	but there are also no redundant while loops or checks. Everything is done in 
	one loop through of the sequence and the status of the resulting sequence being
	a constant or a delta, with constant being preferred. We saw early on that certain 
	conditions can be checked to see right away if a delta plus another delta can be a 
	const, and also if delta+delta=delta or const+delta=delta. However we feel that
	addressing such certain special cases detracts from the elegance and generality of the code.
